# ICS-46-Project5-Rock-and-Roll-Stops-the-Traffic
Dijkstra's Shortest-Path Algorithm | A simplified version of an important piece of such a system: given a map of streets and freeways, along with a snapshot of the current traffic between points on the map, your program will be capable of finding the shortest distance or fastest route to get from one location on the map to another.

All the code I wrote is mainly in core folder. app folder is for the general application of the project. exp folder is for experiment, and gtest folder is for google test.

1. Git pull origin main
2. ./build  // build the project
3. ./run  // run the project
